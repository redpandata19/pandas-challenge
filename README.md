UNC Data Analytic Bootcamp Challenge Description:
You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

Analysis: 
A total of fifteen schools, seven District and eight Charter, were reviewed based on their school size, budget per student, average math scores, average reading scores, percentage of students passing math, percentage of students passing reading, and overall percentage of students passing. In addition, budget per student as well as school size were taken into consideration.

Overall, the top 5 performing schools are all Charter schools, while the bottom 5 are District schools. A potential factor is student body size, the largest schools tend to return the poorest results. However, Wilson High School, a large Charter school (over 2000 students), is within the top 5 for performance. Charter schools consistently spend less per student yet return higher passing rates in every category.
